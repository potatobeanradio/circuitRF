// ================================================================
//  CliEntry.cs — the CLI's dispatch, as a function anyone in this assembly can call.
//
//  This file WAS Program.cs's top-level statements and their local functions, moved wholesale
//  (brief-automation-5-protocol-adapter.md). Nothing in the verbs changed; what changed is that
//  they are now reachable from something other than the process entry point.
//
//  ── Why the move was necessary ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  R-aut-13: nothing may be reachable through the protocol server that is not reachable through the
//  CLI, and vice versa. The cheapest way to make that TRUE BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by care is
//  for the adapter to call the verb, not to re-implement it — and a local function of a top-level
//  program is private to `<Main>$` and callable by nobody. So `serve` translates a tool call into an
//  argument vector and hands it to `Run`, which is the same function `Program.cs` hands the real
//  command line to. The parity gate (ServeProtocolAdapterTests) then compares two documents that
//  came out of one code path, which is what makes a drift between them impossible rather than
//  merely tested for.
//
//  ── What a second caller costs, and what is done about it ─────────────────────────────────────
//
//  `Run` was written once-per-process and is now called repeatedly. Three pieces of state outlive a
//  call and each is handled here rather than left for a caller to remember:
//
//    * JsonRun's collectors — reset by `serve` before every call (JsonRun.Reset).
//    * The device-worker log subscription — an event handler, so a second subscription would print
//      every worker line twice. Hooked once (_workerLogHooked).
//    * Kit resolvers — ExternalDeviceRegistry.AddResolver has no remove, so the same --kits folder
//      set is added once and remembered (_kitsAdded).
